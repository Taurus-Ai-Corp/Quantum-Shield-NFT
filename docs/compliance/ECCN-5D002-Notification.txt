=== CLASSIFICATION ===

Export Control Classification Number (ECCN): 5D002

Description:
Quantum-Shield-NFT is open-source encryption software for post-quantum cryptographic protection of digital assets (NFTs) using NIST-standardized algorithms. The software provides:

1. ML-DSA-65 (Module-Lattice Digital Signature Algorithm) - FIPS 204
2. ML-KEM-768 (Module-Lattice Key Encapsulation Mechanism) - FIPS 203
3. SHA3-256 hashing
4. Hedera Hashgraph blockchain timestamping integration

All cryptographic implementations are derived from publicly available NIST standards and open-source libraries.

=== LICENSE EXCEPTION ELIGIBILITY ===

This software qualifies for License Exception TSU under 15 CFR § 740.13(e) because:

1. ✅ The source code is publicly available (GitHub)
2. ✅ It is not subject to an express agreement for payment of licensing fee or royalty for commercial production or sale
3. ✅ It is cryptographic source code that has been made publicly available
4. ✅ A copy of this notification is being sent to crypt@bis.doc.gov and enc@nsa.gov
5. ✅ The publicly available URL is provided below

=== TECHNICAL DETAILS ===

Cryptographic Algorithms:
- ML-DSA-65 (NIST FIPS 204) - Post-Quantum Digital Signatures
  - Key size: 2,592 bytes (public), 4,032 bytes (private)
  - Security level: NIST Security Level 3 (~192-bit classical security)
  - Implementation: @noble/post-quantum v0.5.2

- ML-KEM-768 (NIST FIPS 203) - Post-Quantum Key Encapsulation
  - Key size: 1,184 bytes (public), 2,400 bytes (private)
  - Security level: NIST Security Level 3 (~192-bit classical security)
  - Implementation: @noble/post-quantum v0.5.2

- SHA3-256 - Cryptographic Hash Function
  - Hash output: 256 bits
  - Implementation: @noble/hashes v1.6.6

- Hedera Hashgraph Integration
  - HTS (Hedera Token Service) - NFT token management
  - HCS (Hedera Consensus Service) - Immutable timestamping
  - SDK: @hashgraph/sdk v2.50.0

Crypto-Agility States:
1. HBAR_SIGN: Hedera Ed25519 signatures (quantum-vulnerable, legacy)
2. HYBRID_SIGN: Dual signatures (ML-DSA-65 + Ed25519)
3. ML-DSA_ONLY: Pure post-quantum signatures
4. QUANTUM_EXPERIMENTAL: Research/testing mode
5. MIGRATION_COMPLETE: Full PQC transition

=== USE CASE ===

Quantum-Shield-NFT enables organizations to protect digital assets (NFTs representing art, intellectual property, documents, certificates) against future quantum computing attacks. The software:

1. Creates quantum-safe signatures for NFT metadata
2. Implements cryptographic agility for migration from classical to post-quantum algorithms
3. Anchors quantum-protected hashes to Hedera blockchain for timestamped provenance
4. Supports 5-state migration path for gradual transition

Target Markets:
- Financial services (digital securities, asset tokenization)
- Healthcare (medical records, HIPAA compliance)
- Legal (contracts, notarization, chain of custody)
- Enterprise (intellectual property, supply chain)
- Government (document authenticity, records management)
