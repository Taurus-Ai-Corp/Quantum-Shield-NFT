### (Existing Projects) List of Improvements Made

```
During the hackathon period (Nov 3-21, 2025), we built upon existing quantum cryptography research and Hedera ecosystem foundations:

1. NIST FIPS 204 Implementation: Integrated ML-DSA (Module-Lattice Digital Signature Algorithm) based on NIST standardization finalized August 2024, implementing all three security levels (44, 65, 87).

2. Hedera Native Integration: Built comprehensive integration with Hedera Token Service (HTS), Hedera Consensus Service (HCS), and Smart Contracts, leveraging Hedera's aBFT consensus for quantum-proof infrastructure.

3. Production-Ready Architecture: Transformed research prototypes into production-ready codebase with error handling, testing, and deployment scripts.

4. Multi-Track Innovation: Extended quantum research into AI agents (ERC-8004), DeFi gamification, NVIDIA quantum computing, and cross-chain bridges.

5. Real-World Application: Created first quantum-resistant NFT marketplace demonstrating practical implementation of post-quantum cryptography in blockchain.

6. Open Source Contribution: Made all code open-source, contributing to Hedera ecosystem and quantum cryptography community.

7. Documentation & Demos: Created comprehensive documentation, interactive demos, and submission materials for hackathon judges.

All improvements are visible in GitHub commit history from Nov 3-21, 2025.

## Project Description * (100 words max)

```
QuantumShield Legacy Builders: Building on NIST FIPS 204 quantum cryptography research and Hedera's proven infrastructure to create production-ready quantum-resistant blockchain solution. We've transformed research prototypes into working implementation, integrating ML-DSA signatures with Hedera's aBFT consensus. Features include NIST-compliant quantum cryptography, Hedera native integration, production-ready architecture, and real-world NFT marketplace application. Demonstrating how existing quantum research can be practically applied to protect blockchain infrastructure, contributing to Hedera ecosystem while advancing post-quantum cryptography adoption.
