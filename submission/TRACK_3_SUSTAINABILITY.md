## Project Description * (100 words max)

```
QuantumShield Sustainability: Leveraging Hedera's carbon-negative hashgraph consensus to build sustainable quantum-resistant infrastructure. Our solution reduces energy consumption by 99% compared to proof-of-work blockchains while providing quantum security for future decades. By using Hedera's efficient aBFT consensus (10,000+ TPS with minimal energy), we eliminate the need for quantum-vulnerable rebuilds that would consume massive resources. Features include energy-efficient ML-DSA signatures, sustainable NFT marketplace, and carbon-negative transaction processing. Built for long-term sustainability, protecting digital assets without compromising environmental responsibility.

## Additional Remarks

```
Demo Credentials: No login required - fully interactive demo
Test Environment: Live demo accessible at GitHub Pages URL
Sustainability Features:
1. Built on Hedera's carbon-negative network
2. 99% less energy than proof-of-work blockchains
3. Efficient ML-DSA signatures (minimal computational overhead)
4. Long-term security prevents resource-intensive rebuilds
5. Sustainable infrastructure for future-proof digital assets

Environmental Impact: By preventing quantum-vulnerable infrastructure rebuilds, we save millions of kWh that would be consumed by migrating entire blockchain systems. Our solution is built for sustainability from day one.
