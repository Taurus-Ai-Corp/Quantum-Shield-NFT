### Project Description (100 words - EXACT COPY)
```
QuantumShield is the world's first production-ready quantum-resistant NFT marketplace on Hedera Hashgraph. We protect $30B+ monthly NFT transactions from the 2028-2030 quantum computing threat using NIST-approved ML-DSA signatures. Our solution includes verifiable AI agents, DeFi gamification, NVIDIA quantum simulations, and cross-chain bridges—all secured with quantum-resistant cryptography. Built specifically for Hedera's 10,000+ TPS performance, we're addressing the SWIFT 2027 mandate while unlocking new possibilities for DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise applications. Production-ready, not a prototype.
