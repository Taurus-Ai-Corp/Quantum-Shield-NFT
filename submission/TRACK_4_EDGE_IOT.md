## Project Description * (100 words max)

```
QuantumShield Edge Network: Decentralized edge infrastructure for quantum-secured IoT devices on Hedera. Our solution enables edge devices to generate ML-DSA quantum signatures locally, securing IoT data at the edge before transmission. Features include edge node deployment, distributed quantum key generation, IoT device authentication with quantum signatures, and decentralized processing on Hedera's low-latency network. Built for IoT security at scale, protecting billions of connected devices from quantum threats while leveraging Hedera's 3-5 second finality for real-time edge operations.
