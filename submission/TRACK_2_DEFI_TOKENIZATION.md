## Project Description * (100 words max)

```
QuantumShield NFT Marketplace: World's first quantum-resistant NFT marketplace on Hedera with DeFi gamification. We protect $30B+ monthly NFT transactions using NIST-approved ML-DSA signatures, ensuring long-term security against quantum computing threats. Features include quantum-secured NFT minting, trading with ML-DSA signatures, DeFi staking pools (10-20% APR), quest-based reward system, and NFT receipts for every transaction. Built on Hedera's 10,000+ TPS infrastructure with 3-5 second finality. Production-ready solution addressing SWIFT 2027 mandate while revolutionizing NFT ownership security.
