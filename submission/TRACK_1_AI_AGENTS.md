## Project Description * (100 words max)

```
QuantumShield AI Agents: World's first verifiable on-chain AI agent marketplace with quantum-resistant signatures on Hedera. Our ERC-8004 compatible agents execute tasks with ML-DSA quantum signatures, enabling trustless AI automation. Features include agent-to-agent (A2A) quantum-secured communication, reputation system with on-chain proofs, and marketplace for hiring AI agents. Built on Hedera's 10,000+ TPS infrastructure, agents can analyze data, predict markets, audit smart contracts, and generate content—all with quantum-verified results stored on HCS. Production-ready implementation demonstrating the future of autonomous, verifiable AI economies.
