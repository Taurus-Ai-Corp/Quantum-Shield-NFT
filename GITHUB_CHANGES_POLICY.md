# 📋 GitHub Changes Policy - Hackathon Rules

**Hedera Ascension Hackathon 2025**  
**Analysis Date:** November 22, 2025

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULE: No Changes After Deadline

### Rule 4.2 States:
> "No additional commits or edits are allowed after the submission deadline."

**Deadline:** November 21, 2025, 11:59pm ET  
**Current Date:** November 22, 2025  
**Status:** ⚠️ **DEADLINE PASSED**

## 🚫 What This Means

### ❌ NOT ALLOWED After Deadline:
- ❌ No new commits to GitHub repository
- ❌ No edits to submitted files
- ❌ No updates to source code
- ❌ No changes to documentation
- ❌ No modifications to submission materials

### ✅ ALLOWED (Before Deadline):

## 📊 Current Repository Status

### Commits After Deadline:

## 🔍 What Judges Will Check

According to Rule 4.2:
> "Judges will only identify and assess the codes and improvements made during the official hack period (3 to 21 November 2025)"

**This means:**
- Judges will only look at commits dated Nov 3-21, 2025
- Commits after Nov 21 may be ignored or cause disqualification
- Repository state at deadline is what matters

---

## ⚠️ Risk Assessment

### If We Make Changes Now:
- ⚠️ **Risk:** May violate Rule 4.2
- ⚠️ **Risk:** Judges may see post-deadline commits
- ⚠️ **Risk:** Could result in disqualification
- ⚠️ **Risk:** May be seen as non-compliance

### If We Don't Make Changes:
- ✅ **Safe:** Repository state matches deadline

- ✅ **Safe:** Judges see only valid commits
